<p>Happy Juneteenth!</p>
<p>Today is a writing day, and I realized it would be a good idea to document online for adviser accessibility, so here we are.</p>
<p>I don't know if I'm notoriously bad at documentation or if it's been a well-kept secret until right now, but I'm REALLY really <em>really</em> bad at it. I comment my code but never think to put timestamps on it, so ... eesh. But I aim to be organized now that things are getting pretty balls-to-the-walls.</p>
<p>Writing is all proposal-focused; I hope to have something serviceable by the end of the week.</p>
<p>A summary of how the programming itself is going: okay. Using netLogo3D, have a film forming on a substrate. Need to think about upward film growth without getting a sphere, and sedimentation rates. PHREEQC side of things v. lacking right now, but those scripts are easy to write so I'm not concerned about that. Really need to get Precambrian sea geochem data. Python wrapper nonexistent, but that's all I/O stuff which is not so bad.<p>
